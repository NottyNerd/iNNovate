### Why iNNovate?

A recent personal project I enjoyed working on was iNNovate. 
I built the now live application from **scratch** following best practices in **Ideation**, **Rapid prototyping**, **Requirement gathering**, **Mobile Application development** and **Documentation**.
The objective of iNNovate was to create a space for the next one billion users to share their stories and motivation through reading and proactive participation. I explored the use of FireBase by Google as a BaaS and Notification hub, Java for Android development, Photoshop for  Sketches and Figma for rapid prototyping.

This project took about 6 weekends to hack as I had a full-time job as a Software Engineer in Nigeria at the time. The results have been fairly great with users reaching their thousands without any form of marketing. I am mostly impressed by the reviews and how this mini-project has been able to impact the lives of strangers. 



### Project Result

Be an inspiration to others, read interesting quotes and get motivated by reading stories of World icons.
